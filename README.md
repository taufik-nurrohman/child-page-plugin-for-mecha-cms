Child Page Plugin for Mecha CMS
===============================

> Add child page to static pages.

Specify the parent page slug in the custom field to link it (the child page) to the desired page. One level only.

Upload the `child-page` folder along with its contents through the plugin uploader. You need to compress the folder into a ZIP file to simplify the uploading process. After that, go to the plugin manager page and follow the instructions on the **About** tab.
