Child Page Plugin for Mecha CMS
===============================

> Add child page to static pages.

Determine the parent page slug on the custom field provided to link it (the child page) to the desired parent page. Applies only to one level of child page.

Upload the `child-page` folder along with its contents through the plugin uploader. You need to compress the folder into a ZIP file to simplify the uploading process. After that, go to the plugin manager page and follow the instructions on the **About** tab.
